# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Set

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  
Must run in **O(n)** time.

### Examples
- Input: [100,4,200,1,3,2] → Output: 4
- Input: [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1] → Output: 9
- Input: [1,0,1,2] → Output: 3

### Constraints
- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
