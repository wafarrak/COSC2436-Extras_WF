# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Topics:** Tree, DFS, BFS, Design

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. The format can be any, as long as deserializing your output reconstructs the original tree.

### Example 1
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]  
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

### Example 2
Input: root = []  
Output: []

### Constraints
- 0 <= nodes <= 10^4  
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
