# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Topics:** Linked List, Heap, Divide and Conquer

Given an array of `k` linked-lists, each sorted in ascending order, merge them into one sorted list and return it.

### Examples
- Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]] → Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
- Input: lists = [] → Output: []
- Input: lists = [[]] → Output: []

### Constraints
- 0 <= k <= 10^4
- 0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
- The sum of all nodes ≤ 10^4
- -10^4 <= node.val <= 10^4
- Each list is sorted ascending
